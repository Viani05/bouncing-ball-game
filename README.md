A fast-paced, cartoon-style arcade runner inspired by classic mobile tunnel games. Control a shiny red cricket ball as it bounces through themed tunnels, avoids crushing spikes and water gaps, collects sparkling gold coins, and levels up through changing environments.

Tap or click to make the ball bounce. The ball moves forward automatically through a tunnel filled with obstacles and coins. Every 5 levels the tunnel theme changes (Brick → Grassland → Volcano → Ice → Steel), bringing new visuals, sounds, and tougher challenges.
